Thanks to deepReg, companies can avoid costly lawsuits and save time. deepReg helps compliance officers to keep the overview in the fast changing and unstructured field of regulations. Using natural language processing we visualize dependencies between documents and identify important text passages. With the help of machine learning we continuously improve the intelligence and accuracy of deepReg.
